NAME
     moove - moves a file somewhere else

SYNOPSIS
     move <source> <destination> [options]

DESCRIPTION
     moove is a Node.js command-line utility for moving files from
     one location to another on the filesystem. It allows for
     various options to control the move operation.

OPTIONS
     <source>
         The path to the file that you want to move.

     <destination>
         The directory where you want the file to be moved to.

     --dryrun
         Perform a dry run without actually moving the file.
         Default is false.

     -o, --overwrite
         Specify the method of handling existing files at the
         destination.

         auto
             Automatically decide based on the file's existence
             and prompts. This is the default behavior.

         prompt
             Ask the user what to do if the destination file
             exists.

         skip
             Skip moving the file if the destination file exists.

         overwrite
             Overwrite the existing file in the destination.

     -D, --delete
         Delete the source file after moving. Default is true.

EXAMPLES
     To perform a dry run to see what the command would do without
     actually moving any files:

         $ move /path/to/source /path/to/destination --dryrun

     To move a file and overwrite any existing file in the
     destination:

         $ move /path/to/source /path/to/destination --overwrite
         overwrite

     To move a file but keep the source file:

         $ move /path/to/source /path/to/destination --delete
         false
